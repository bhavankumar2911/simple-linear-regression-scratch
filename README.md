# Implementation of simple linear regression from scratch in Java

For simplicity, the source code is written keeping [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohankayan/years-of-experience-and-salary-dataset) dataset in mind. However, the logic is the same and with a few tweaks, it can be generalized for any dataset.

The R-squared score using this model is 0.9569568159989497 and the R-squared score when using sklearn for the same dataset is 0.9569566641435086

Our model's performance is as good as sklearn's model.
